# OpenWebNet (BTicino/Legrand) Binding

This binding integrates BTicino / Legrand MyHOME(r) BUS & ZigBee wireless (MyHOME_Play) devices using the **[OpenWebNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWebNet) protocol**.
It supports:

- *both* wired BUS/SCS (MyHOME) and wireless setups (MyHOME ZigBee) in the same biding; the two networks can be configured simultaneously
- discovery of BUS/SCS IP gateways and ZigBee USB gateways and devices
- commands from openHAB and feedback (events) from BUS/SCS and wireless network
- numeric (`12345`) and alpha-numeric (`abcde` - HMAC authentication) gateway passwords

NOTE
The new BTicino Living Now(r) wireless system is not supported as it does not use the OpenWebNet protocol

## Prerequisites

In order for this biding to work, a **BTicino/Legrand OpenWebNet gateway** is needed in your home system to talk to devices.
These gateways have been tested with the binding:

- **IP gateways** or scenario programmers, such as BTicino 
[F454](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=006), 
[MyHOMEServer1](http://www.bticino.com/products-catalogue/myhome_up-simple-home-automation-system/), 
[MyHOME_Screen10](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?lang=EN&productId=001), 
[MH202](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=059),

## Requirements

This binding requires **openHAB 2.4** or later.

## Discovery

Gateway and Things discovery is supported using PaperUI by pressing the discovery ("+") button form Inbox.

### BUS/SCS Discovery

- BUS Gateway automatic discovery will work only for newer gateways supporting UPnP: F454, MyHOMEServer1, MH202, MH200N, MyHOME_Screen 10.
For other gateways you can add them manually, see [Thing Configuration](#thing-configuration) below.
- After gateway is discovered and added a connection with default password (`12345`) is tested first: if it does not work the gateway will go offline and an error status will be set. A correct password must then be set in the gateway Thing configuration otherwise the gateway will not become online.
- Once the gateway is online, a second Scan request from Inbox will discover BUS devices
- BUS/SCS Dimmers must be ON and dimmed (30%-100%) during a Scan, otherwise they will be discovered as simple On/Off switches
    - *KNOWN ISSUE*: In some cases dimmers connected to a F429 Dali-interface are not automatically discovered
- CEN/CEN+ Scenario Control devices will be discovered by activation only. See [discovery by activation](#discovery-by-activation) for details. After confirming a discovered CEN/CEN+ device from Inbox, activate again its scenario buttons and refresh the PaperUI Control page to see button channels appear.

#### Discovery by Activation

Devices can also be discovered if activated while a Inbox Scan is active: start a new Scan, wait 15-20 seconds and then _while the Scan is still active_ (spinning arrow in Inbox), activate the physical device (for example dim the dimmer, push a CEN/CEN+ Scenario button, etc.) to have it discovered by the binding.

If a device cannot be discovered automatically it's always possible to add them manually, see [Configuring Devices](#configuring-devices).

### Wireless (ZigBee) Discovery

- The ZigBee USB Gateway must be inserted in one of the USB ports of the openHAB computer before discovery is started
- ***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** As for other OH2 using the USB/serial ports, on Linux the `openhab` user must be member of the `dialout` group, to be able to use USB/serial port:

    ```
    $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout openhab
    ```

    The user will need to logout and login to see the new group added. If you added your user to this group and still cannot get permission, reboot Linux to ensure the new group permission is attached to the `openhab` user.
- Once the gateway is discovered and added, a second discovery request from Inbox will discover devices. Because of the ZigBee radio network, discovery will take ~40-60 sec. Be patient!
- Wireless devices must be part of the same ZigBee network of the ZigBee USB Gateway to discover them. Please refer to [this guide by BTicino](http://www.bticino.com/products-catalogue/management-of-connected-lights-and-shutters/#installation) to setup a ZigBee wireless network which includes the ZigBee USB Gateway 
- Only powered wireless devices part of the same ZigBee network and within radio coverage of the ZigBee USB Gateway will be discovered. Unreachable or not powered devices will be discovered as *GENERIC* devices and cannot be controlled. Control units cannot be discovered by the ZigBee USB Gateway and therefore are not supported


## Thing Configuration

### Configuring BUS/SCS Gateway

To add a gateway manually using PaperUI: go to *Inbox > "+" > OpenWebNet > click `ADD MANUALLY`* and then select `OpenWebNet BUS Gateway` device.

Parameters for configuration:

- `host` : IP address / hostname of the BUS/SCS gateway (`String`, *mandatory*)
   - Example: `192.168.1.35`
- `port` : port (`int`, *optional*, default: `20000`)
- `passwd` : gateway password (`String`, *required* for gateways that have a password set. Default: `12345`)
   - Example: `abcde` or `12345`
   - if the BUS/SCS gateway is configured to accept connections from the openHAB computer IP address, no password should be required
   - in all other cases, a password must be set. This includes gateways that have been discovered and added from Inbox that without a password settings will not become ONLINE
- `discoveryByActivation`: discover BUS devices when they are activated also when a device scan is not currently active (`boolean`, *optional*, default: `false`). See [Discovery by Activation](#discovery-by-activation).

Alternatively the BUS/SCS Gateway thing can be configured using the `.things` file, see `openwebnet.things` example [below](#full-example).

### Configuring Wireless ZigBee USB Gateway 

The wireless ZigBee USB Gateway is discovered automatically and added in Inbox.

Manual configuration *is not supported* at the moment.

### Configuring Devices

Devices can be discovered automatically from Inbox after their gateway has been configured and connected.

Devices can be also added manually from PaperUI. For each device it must be configured:

- the associated gateway (`Bridge Selection` menu)
- the `WHERE` config parameter (`OpenWebNet Device Address`):
  - example for BUS/SCS: Point to Point `A=2 PL=4` --> `WHERE="24"`
  - example for BUS/SCS: Point to Point `A=6 PL=4` on local bus --> `WHERE="64#4#01"`
  - example for BUS/SCS thermo Zones: `Zone=1` --> `WHERE="1"`; external probe `5` --> `WHERE="500"`
  - example for ZigBee devices: use decimal format address without the UNIT part and network: ZigBee `WHERE=414122201#9` --> `WHERE="4141222"`
  - for CEN+ use 2+N[0-2047], example: Scenario Control `5` --> `WHERE=25`


## Channels

Devices support some of the following channels:

| Channel Type ID (channel ID)        | Item Type     | Description                                                             | Read/Write |

### Notes on channels

#### `shutter` position

For Percent commands and position feedback to work correctly, the `shutterRun` Thing config parameter must be configured equal to the time (in ms) to go from full UP to full DOWN.
It's possible to enter a value manually or set `shutterRun=AUTO` (default) to calibrate shutterRun parameter automatically the first time a Percent command is sent to the shutter: a *UP >> DOWN >> Position%* cycle will be performed automatically.

- if shutterRun is not set, or is set to AUTO but calibration has not been performed yet, then position estimation will remain `UNDEFINED`
- if shutterRun is set manually and too higher than the actual runtime, then position estimation will remain `UNDEFINED`: try to reduce shutterRun until you find the right value
- before adding/configuring roller shutter Things (or installing a binding update) it is suggested to have all roller shutters `UP`, otherwise the Percent command won’t work until the roller shutter is fully rolled up
- if the gateways gets disconnected then the binding cannot know anymore where the shutter was: if `shutterRun` is defined (and correct), then just roll the shutter all Up / Down and its position will be estimated again
- the shutter position is estimated based on UP/DOWN timing and therefore an error of ±2% is normal

#### `heating` and `cooling`

`heating` and `cooling` channels assume that your BTicino heating/cooling actuators are configured as #1 and #2 respectively.
To ensure the heating/cooling actuators are set up correctly for a Thermostat:

1. open *MyHome_Suite*
2. go to Thermostat configuration panel > *Plant settings* 
3. in *Actuators section* check if the first actuator listed is numbered "1". This will be the actuator which state will be returned by the binding in the `heating` channel.
4. if it is not numbered "1", find the actuator device corresponding to the same Thermo zone of the Thermostat and set the "Device number" property to "1"
5. repeat steps 3. and 4. for `cooling` using actuator number "2"

#### `scenarioButton`

- In CEN/CEN+ channels are named `button_X` where `X` is the button number on the Scenario Control device
- Button channels appear in PaperUI after the first time the corresponding button is activated from the physical device. Refresh the PaperUI/Control page if needed
- When using file configuration, in the Thing configuration use the `buttons` parameter to define a comma-separated list of buttons numbers [0-31] configured for the scenario device, example: `buttons=1,2,4`. See [openwebnet.things](#openwebnet-things) for an example
- channel possible values are:
    - `PRESSED` and then just after `RELEASED` when a CEN/CEN+ button is short-pressed (<0.5sec)
    - `PRESSED_EXT` (updated again every 0.5sec) and then `RELEASED_EXT` when a CEN/CEN+ button is long pressed (>=0.5sec)
- Sending on channels `button_X` the commands: `PRESSED`, `RELEASED`, etc. will simulate a *virtual short/long pressure* of the corresponding CEN/CEN+ button, enabling the activation of MH202 scenarios on the BUS from openHAB. See [openwebnet.sitemap](#openwebnet-sitemap) & [openwebnet.rules](#openwebnet-rules) sections for an example


## Integration with assistants

To be visible to assistants like Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa/Apple HomeKit (Siri) an item must have the correct tag.
Items created automatically with PaperUI (Simple Mode item linking: `Configuration > System > Item Linking > Simple mode > SAVE`) will get automatically the default tag from the binding: in particular items associated with these channels will have the following tags:

- `switch` / `brightness` channels will have the `Lighting` tag
- `shutter` channel will have the `Blinds` tag
- `temperature` channel will have the `CurrentTemperature` tag
- `setpointTemperature` channel will have the `TargetTemperature` tag
- `heatingCoolingMode` channel will have the `homekit:HeatingCoolingMode` tag

After configuration, you can double-check which tags are set looking at the `tags` attribute in the REST API: http://openhabianpi.local:8080/rest/items.

**NOTE For items created automatically with PaperUI tags are added automatically by the OpenWebNet binding, but you have to check which tags are actually supported by each openHAB add-on (Google Assistant/Alexa/HomeKit).**

After items and their correct tags are set, it will be enough to link openHAB with [myopenhab](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/openhabcloud/) and with the Google Assistant/Alexa/HomeKit add-on, and you will be able to discover/control BTicino items from assistants.


The device name imported in the assistant will be label given to the item, and not the item name; usually you can rename devices in the assistants.
(item labels are not mandatory in openHAB, but for the Google Assistant Action they are absolutely necessary)

Note that the most flexible configuration is obtained using `.items` file: see the examples below.

See these official docs and other threads in the OH community for more information about Google Assistant/Alexa/HomeKit integration and configuration:

- Google Assistant (Google Home): <https://www.openhab.org/docs/ecosystem/google-assistant/>
- Amazon Alexa: <https://www.openhab.org/docs/ecosystem/alexa/>
- Apple HomeKit (Siri): <https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/homekit/>

***NOTE***
You will need to add tags manually for items created using PaperUI when Simple Mode item linking is de-activated, or for items created using `.items` file.

- This binding uses `openwebnet-lib 0.9.x`, an OpenWebNet Java lib partly based on [openwebnet/rx-openwebnet](https://github.com/openwebnet/rx-openwebnet) client library by @niqdev, to support:
    - gateways and OWN frames for ZigBee
    - frame parsing
    - monitoring events from BUS
  
  The lib also uses few modified classes from the old openHAB 1.x BTicino binding for socket handling and priority queues.
